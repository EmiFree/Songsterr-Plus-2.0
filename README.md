This extension no longer works and hasn't been updated for some time. However, there is an alternative method that works as of October 2024.

2) Open the extension and make a new script and delete all the auto-generated code and headers
3) Paste [this code](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/469079/Songsterr%20Premium%20-%20songsterrcom.user.js) (This code is not made or owned by me or the creators of this repo, I am simply adding it here because I have tested it and it works for me)
